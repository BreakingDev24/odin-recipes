    <h2>The most popular cocktail in America</h2>

    <p>
        The classic Margarita cocktail has been one of the most popular cocktails in America for years and still remains on top. While there are many variations, the traditional recipe consists of tequila, Triple Sec and lime juice. It's also often served with a salt rim for the perfect balance of sweet, sour and salty.
